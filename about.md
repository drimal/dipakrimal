I am a Research Scientist at The Bee Corp in Indianapolis. We use IR (infrared) imaging technlogy to build predictive models of bee colony strength inside beehives. Before coming to Bee Corp, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Florida, where I analyzed data from neturino-nucleus interactions at the MINERvA detector at Fermilab.
