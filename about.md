I work at The Bee Corp in Indianapolis, where we use IR (Infra-Red) imaging technology to build predictive models to assess colony strength inside beehives. Before Bee Corp, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Florida, where I analyzed data from neutrino-nucleus interactions at the MINERvA detector at Fermilab.Â
