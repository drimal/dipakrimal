I work at The Bee Corp in Indianapolis, where we use IR (Infra-Red) imaging technology to build predictive models to assess colony strength inside beehives. Before Joining Bee Corp, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Florida for 5 years. As postdoc, I analyzed neutrino-nucleus interaction data from Fermilab's MINERvA detector. I have more than 12 years of experience extracting insights from wide varieties of datasets. I love to travel and enjoy natural wonders.
